# public_monorepo

This repo holds all of my junk code. Meaning public code that I don't care
people seeing, but that I'm also not actively collaborating with anyone else.

## Projects

- `CS4600-p1` is the first project for the CS4600 course.
- `gilded_rose` is a ruby refactoring kata. I didn't write this but rather
    copied it from somewhere.
