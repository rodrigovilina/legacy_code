# topdown-shooter

This repo holds an unnamed topdown 2d shooter game made for learning purposes.


## Why I'm making this game

I'm making this game mostly for learning. Some of the learning objectives are:
  - Practive Event-Driven development
  - Sync a server with a few clients via tcp


## Scope

I intend to work on this repository for at most two months and implement
the following features:
  - There is a bounded rectangular map
  - There are solid obstacles
  - You can move the player using the wasd keys
  - You can shoot a bullet in the direction of your cursor with both the
      keyboard and the mouse
  - There is one type of monster with a movement algorithm
  - You can kill all the monsters and win the game
  - You loose if you get touched
  - All objects are rectangles
  - You can have a second player join to help

## Running

Open the client with `cargo run --bin client`
